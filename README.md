# Simple Commander (simcom)

## Goal
Mimic Norton Commander functionality using a  web interface and the websocket.

## Technologies
- Rust
- WebSocket
- 

## Dependencies
Currently the project has 3 direct dependecies:

- [SimJSON](https://github.com/vernisaz/simjson)
- [SimWEb](https://github.com/vernisaz/simweb)
- [SimTime](https://github.com/vernisaz/simtime)
-

## Web server
Since the project uses the websocket, only the [SimHTTP](https://github.com/vernisaz/simhttp) can be used to run it.
Hopefully more vendors will adopt the functionality soon and a list of supporting servers will be extended after.

## Status
There is an alpha version you can try.
